        <h3 id="text">Video Editing</h3>
          <p id="texts">I am certified in Adobe Production and had been editing
          videos using the softwar. But soon after i moved onto vegas
          production which i found a lot easier to edit with everything
          i wanted in a video. The reason why i use anime as the view is
          because it shows extreme exageration in emotions that we humans
          can't/don't show.
