      <h3>Video Editing</h3>
      <p>I am certified in Adobe Production and had been editing
      videos using the softwar. But soon after i moved onto vegas
      production which i found a lot easier to edit with everything
      i wanted in a video. The reason why i use anime as the view is
      because it shows extreme exageration in emotions that we humans
      can't/don't show.
